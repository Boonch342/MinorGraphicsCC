Now there's the Eldeer, Grandmas, Wrinklers and trios, as well as the others and the pilk if I ever use it     

Just for the record none of the is mine pretty much and all of it is from generous people on the steam workshop, but it's here now so...     

Also I forgor to name any of the code ".js" at the end so an unlabled file is code     
Womp womp     

Okay now I'm adding the "more wallpapers"
